Labtainers: A Docker-based cyber lab framework
==============================================

Labtainers include more than 45 cyber lab exercises and tools to build your own. Import a single VM appliance or install on a Linux system and your students are done with provisioning and administrative setup, for these and future lab exercises.

* Consistent lab execution environments and automated provisioning via Docker containers
* Multi-component network topologies on a modestly performing laptop computer 
* Automated assessment of student lab activity and progress
* Individualized lab exercises to discourage sharing solutions

Labtainers provide controlled and consistent execution environments in which students perform labs entirely within the confines of their computer, regardless of the Linux distribution and packages installed on the student's computer.  The only requirement is that the Linux system supports Docker.  See the [Papers][Papers] for additional information about the framework.
The Labtainers website, and downloads (including VM appliances with Labtainers pre-installed) are at <https://my.nps.edu/web/c3o/labtainers>.

## Distribution and Use
Please see the licensing and distribution information
in the [docs/license.md file](docs/license.md).

## Guide to directories

* scripts/labtainers-student -- the work directory for running and 
   testing student labs.  You must be in that directory to run 
   student labs.
   
* scripts/labtainers-instructor -- the work directory for 
   running and testing automated assessment and viewing student
   results.
  
* labs -- Files specific to each of the labs
   
* setup_scripts -- scripts for installing Labtainers and Docker and updating Labtainers
   
* docs -- latex source for the labdesigner.pdf, and other documentation.
   
* config -- system-wide configuration settings (these are not the 
   lab-specific configuration settings.
 
* distrib -- distribution support scripts, e.g., for publishing labs to the Docker hub.

* testsets -- Test procedures and expected results. (Per-lab drivers for SimSec are not 
distributed).

* pkg-mirrors -- utility scripts for internal NPS package mirroring to reduce external 
package pulling during tests and distribution.

## Release notes

The standard Labtainers distribution does not include files required for development
of new labs.  For those, run ./update-designer.sh from the labtainer/trunk/setup\_scripts directory.

The installation script and the update-designer.sh script set environment variables,
so you may want to logout/login, or start a new bash shell before using Labtainers the
first time.
